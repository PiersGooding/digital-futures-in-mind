						<h2 id="digitising-involuntary-psychiatric-intervention">1.3 Digitising Involuntary Psychiatric Intervention and Other Coercive Measures</h2>
						<div class="neon-blue-txt">Possibly more than any other group of patients, people with mental
							health problems can experience particular forms of power and authority
							in service systems and treatment. They are the only people with long-term conditions who are subject to compulsory treatment under law. The
							implications of these specific power dynamics as well as potential biases
							in mental health systems must be considered for the ethical development
							and implementation of any data-driven technology in mental health.<br />
							- Sarah Carr<sup>51</sup></div>
						<p>Unlike data concerning physical health, data concerning mental health can be used to
							initiate state-authorised coercive interventions in certain cases. This possibility adds
							important legal, social and political dynamics to this discussion. Although the majority
							of people who access some kind of service for mental health reasons will access those
							services voluntarily, a small but significant minority of people will be subject to involuntary
							psychiatric intervention – typically involving the person being detained in hospital and
							treated against her/his/their wishes – under existing mental health-related legislation</p>
						<h3 id="self-harm-surveillance">1.3.1 AI-based Suicide Alerts and Self-harm Surveillance</h3>
						<p>Government agencies, social media companies, not-for-profits, health services, and
							others have begun using machine learning and artificial intelligence in suicide prevention,
							including in efforts to pre-emptively identify people who may self-harm.52 In some cases,
							these technologies appear to have been used to activate police powers to detain people
							for the purposes of involuntary psychiatric intervention.</p>
						<div class="skydivbox">
							<h2>CASE STUDY: AI-Based Suicide Alerts at Facebook/Meta</h2>
							<p>In November 2018, a Facebook employee in Texas reportedly alerted police in the
								Indian state of Maharashtra about a 21-year-old man who had posted a suicide
								note on his profile. The intervention came after Facebook expanded its pattern
								recognition software to detect users expressing suicidal intent. Mumbai police
								reportedly attended the young man’s home,<sup>53</sup> for which they have power to authorise
								involuntary psychiatric intervention under the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 (India). In
								2018, Facebook reported that it had conducted over 1000 ‘wellness checks’ involving
								the dispatch of first responders.<sup>54</sup></p>
						</div>
						<p>Facebook/Meta’s algorithmic responses also encourage peer-responses from among
							the person’s user-network by drawing their attention to the person’s apparent distress.<sup>55</sup>
							These measures were developed after some form of consultation with suicide attempt
							survivors and experts on suicide prevention (though few details are available).<sup>56</sup>
							Facebook/Meta provides some information about the algorithmic process behind the
							interventions,<sup>57</sup> and has described the ethical issues with which programmers grappled.<sup>58</sup></p>
						
						<p>However, there remains little information about what precisely is meant by a ‘wellness
							check’ (including whether location data are shared with first-responders). Nor is there
							publicly available research as to the accuracy, scale or effectiveness of the initiative. What
							Facebook/Meta does with the information following each apparent crisis is also unclear.</p>
						<p>Police appear to be the first-responders undertaking ‘wellness checks’. Facebook/Meta
							has therefore drawn criticism for failing to grapple with the reality of anti-Black racism
							in the US and the prevalence of police violence in their encounters with distressed
							individuals, particularly Black, Indigenous, people of colour. For example, Joshua Skorburg
							and Phoebe Friesen write:</p>
						<div class="benifit-box">
							<ul>
								<li>While [Facebook/Meta’s wellness checks] may seem like a positive contribution to
									public health on Facebook’s behalf, it is becoming increasingly clear that police wellness
									checks can do more harm than good. Between 2015 and August 5, 2020, 1,362 people
									who were experiencing mental health issues were killed by police in the United States.
									This remarkable number constitutes 23 percent of police fatalities in that time.<sup>59</sup></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>The US is by no means alone on such patterns of police violence.<sup>60</sup></p>
						<p>From a legal and regulatory perspective, suicide prediction in medical systems is
							governed by health information laws, medical practice and clinical governance regimes,
							and research regulations that require transparency and peer review. Flawed as these
							frameworks may be, AI-based suicide prediction on social media platforms, as Mason
							Marks points out, ‘typically occurs outside the healthcare system where it is almost
							completely unregulated, and corporations often maintain their prediction methods as
							proprietary trade secrets’.<sup>61</sup> To remedy this, Marks recommends several steps to improve
							people’s safety, privacy and autonomy, including:<sup>62</sup></p>

						<div class="benifit-box">
							<ul>
								<li>making prediction methods more transparent, and giving users unambiguous
									opportunities to opt-out and delete prediction information;</li>
								<li>protecting consumer privacy and minimising the risk of exploitation, by ensuring suicide
									predictions cannot be used for advertising or be shared with third parties (such as
									insurance companies, employers or immigration authorities); and</li>
								<li> the monitoring of ongoing prediction programs by independent data monitoring
									committees for safety and efficacy.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>The use of individual and population monitoring in efforts to prevent suicide or efforts
							to promote its use, are likely to increase in coming years. In December 2020, the US
							National Suicide Prevention Lifeline administrator recommended that the US Government
							authorise geo-location systems to pin-point the exact location of all callers by 2022.<sup>63</sup>
							Leah Harris has criticised this recommendation, warning that ‘Mad and disabled advocates
							who have experienced mental health crisis intervention, and even some crisis service
							providers, worry that geolocation would serve to further entrench coercion in mental
							health and crisis response systems, replicating problematic aspects of [the US emergency
							services line] 911’.<sup>64</sup> The impact of automated surveillance of callers on rates of involuntary
							psychiatric interventions, police involvement in crises, citizens’ willingness to report to
							such services, and so on, remains unknown.</p>
							
						<h3 id="digitising-mental-health-law">1.3.2 ‘Digitising mental health law</h3>
							<p>Some governments have sought to digitise processes of involuntary psychiatric
								intervention.<sup>65</sup></p>
							<div class="skydivbox">
								<h2>CASE STUDY: Electronic Forms and Mobile Technology in Involuntary Psychiatric
									Interventions</h2>
								<p>In the UK in 2020, regulations were amended to speed up applications for
									compulsory psychiatric ntervention orders by providing an online communication
									platform between mental health professionals involved in involuntary interventions.
									This web-based interface allows social workers, nurses, psychologists and others
									who are interacting with a person in crisis to locate and communicate with medical
									practitioners via videocall who may assess the person and authorise involuntary
									intervention. One online platform to emerge with government support is reportedly
									used by over 70% of National Health Service Trusts at the time of writing.<sup>66</sup> David
									Bradley, the Chief Executive of South London & Maudsley NHS, strongly endorses
									the practice, describing it as ‘[t]he Uber of finding doctors for the health service’.<sup>67</sup>
									Relevant doctors can enter their availability on a personal calendar and ‘build a profile
									containing their location, specialities and languages spoken, and monitor their activity
									via a dashboard’.<sup>68</sup></p>
							</div>
							<p>Proponents suggest the electronic forms and digital platforms will improve access to care,
								reduce errors, and improve information sharing, which ultimately reduces the distress of the
								individuals and prevents delays in the provision of healthcare.69 However, some mental health
								services users have raised concerns about the unknown impact of the digitised process on
								people subject to orders, which are potentially serious and warrant closer attention.<sup>70</sup></p>
							<p>In recent years, the processing of data about those subject to involuntary psychiatric
								intervention through electronic records systems has harmed people with lived experience
								in some cases. Concerns about police agencies sharing data concerning self-harm were
								raised in Canada, where municipal police collated non-criminal information about individuals
								who had self-injured or attempted suicide.71 The information was then circulated to US
								border authorities, who used the information to deny several Canadians entry into the US.
								(This example will be discussed at page 52). The ease with which people’s sensitive data
								concerning involuntary treatment can be accessed by various government departments,
								has raised concerns about the potentially unlawful uses of that data.</p>
								
							<div class="skydivbox">
								<h2>CASE STUDY: ‘Serenity Integrated Monitoring’ – Sharing Sensitive Information and
									Flagging ‘High Intensity Users’ of Mental Health Services</h2>
								<p>CASE STUDY: ‘Serenity Integrated Monitoring’ – Sharing Sensitive Information and
									Flagging ‘High Intensity Users’ of Mental Health Services</p>
								<br />
								<p>The program involved police officers, described as ‘High Intensity Officers’, regularly
									contacting the person to dissuade them from ‘unnecessary’ interactions with
									emergency health services, and to instead arrange more ‘appropriate’ support.<sup>73</sup> Major
									concerns with the program were reported in May 2021</p>
								<p class="sm-padd-gap">[w]hen tagged under the system, patients can be denied care, prevented from
									seeing doctors or psychiatrists, and sent home. An NHS doctor told [journalists]
									that he had to turn away a woman who had attempted suicide on multiple
									occasions because she had been assigned to the SIM scheme. He considered
									resigning as a result.<sup>74</sup></p>
								<p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists reported that where a person ‘remained unwell
									and continued to self-harm, attempt suicide or report suicidality, in some cases they
									were prosecuted and imprisoned or community protection notices were applied
									which required them to stop self-harming or calling for help, with imprisonment as a
									potential sanction if they breached the notice’.<sup>75</sup></p>
								<br />
								<p>StopSIM Coalition, a ‘grassroots network of service users and allies’, raised concerns
									that the program ‘allows “sensitive data” (information like medical records, ethnicity,
									religion, sexuality, gender reassignment and financial information) to be shared
									between services without the subject’s consent … (for example, as a consequence of
									calling [emergency services] when feeling suicidal)’.<sup>76</sup></p>
								<br />
								<p>The SIM program is being reviewed by the National Health Service at the time of
									writing, although it reportedly remains in place in 23 National Health Service mental
									health trusts in England<sup>77</sup> and is being trialled in three US states.<sup>78</sup></p>
							</div>
							<p>The SIM program will be discussed later in the report in sections on accountability and
								privatisation (page 58). SIM also appeared to have disproportionate impacts along lines of
								race and class (discussed at page 69)</p>
								
							<h3 id="power-and-coercion-in-mental-health">1.3.3 Power and Coercion in Mental Health</h3>
							<p>Other areas of law around the world overtly discriminate against people with lived
								experience and psychosocial disability, which adds to the sensitivity of data concerning
								mental health. Discrimination in law could include preventing a person with a mental
								health diagnosis from holding public office, migrating into particular countries, and
								working in particular professions.<sup>79</sup> Indeed, some countries continue to criminalise suicide
								attempts. For example, Section 226 of Kenya’s penal code states that ‘any person who
								attempts to kill himself [sic] is guilty of a misdemeanour’.<sup>80</sup> Around 20 countries still
								criminalise suicide attempts, according to a 2021 report by the International Association
								for Suicide Prevention and United for Global Mental Health.<sup>81</sup> Automated suicide
								alert programs must therefore be applied with extreme caution (see section on Non-Discrimination and Equity below)</p>
							<p>There are also well-established examples where people with psychosocial disabilities and
								mental health diagnoses are occasionally subject to political scapegoating and public
								scare campaigns that attract intrusive and discriminatory proposals for state intervention.</p>
							<div class="skydivbox">
								<h2>CASE STUDY: ‘SAFEHOME for Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome
									Mental Extremes’ – Proposed Behavioural Monitoring and Preventive Policing</h2>
								<p>In 2019, the Washington Post reported that a prominent US businessman briefed top
									officials of the Trump administration, including the then president and vice president,
									on a proposal ‘to create a new research arm called the Health Advanced Research
									Projects Agency’.<sup>82</sup> The advisor promoted a program titled, ‘SAFEHOME for Stopping
									Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes’ that called for
									experimentation to explore whether ‘technology including phones and smartwatches
									can be used to detect when mentally ill people are about to turn violent’.<sup>83</sup> The
									proposal was not pursued by the time Donald Trump left office in 2020</p>
							</div>
							<p>One category of biometric monitoring technology more broadly, known as ‘anomaly
								detection’, may have repercussions for people with psychosocial disabilities and lived
								experience if used in public surveillance. According to one report, automated surveillance
								systems are designed undertake ‘automatic detection and tracking of unusual objects
								and people’.<sup>84</sup> The literature on anomaly detection, according to a report for the ACLU, is
								‘full of discussion of algorithms that can detect people or behaviours that are “unusual,”
								“abnormal,” “deviant,” or “atypical”’.<sup>85</sup> (See above the discussion about the politics of
								terminology in the mental health context, including characterisations of ‘deviance’ and
								‘abnormality’, page 13).<sup>86</sup> The authors warn that identifying statistical deviance is not a negative thing per se but when it ‘shades into finding deviant people it should raise
								alarms’,<sup>87</sup> and given the historical and current exclusion of, and social hostility against,
								people with lived experience and psychosocial disability, and other disabilities, such as
								intellectual and cognitive disabilities, this is particularly troubling</p>
								
							<p>A less experimental form of electronic monitoring at the intersection of mental health
								and criminal justice is the use of monitoring of people in forensic mental health services
								using global positioning system (GPS). Electronic monitoring devices record and
								regularly transmit data on a person’s location via devices fixed to his or her body.
								Some GPS devices, such as devices affixed to a person’s wrist or ankle, can be linked
								to blood-alcohol monitors.<sup>88</sup></p>
							<div class="skydivbox">
								<h2>CASE STUDY: GPS Surveillance of Forensic Psychiatric Patients in Three
									Jurisdictions</h2>
								<p>Two jurisdictions in Australia authorise health services to impose involuntary
									‘monitoring conditions’ on people detained in forensic psychiatric settings using
									electronic GPS devices, typically in the form of electronic ankle bracelets.89 In one
									jurisdiction, the program was advanced by government against the submissions
									and evidence of medical practitioners.90 In an appeal brought by a man subject to
									the surveillance regime,91 a treating psychiatrist submitted that ‘[n]ot only did [the]
									device add nothing to his clinical management or risk reduction, it had the effect of
									hindering his rehabilitation’.<sup>92</sup></p>
								<br />
								<p>In England and Wales, GPS surveillance of people in forensic mental health settings is
									only possible if they consent to it.<sup>93</sup> In Nova Scotia, Canada, legislators have prohibited
									GPS surveillance of forensic mental health patients in any form, with lawmakers citing
									concerns that it violates human rights.<sup>94</sup> The province commissioned three reports
									into the clinical and legal issues, and each study indicated that ‘there was no support
									or even speculative support that electronic monitoring would enhance public safety.<sup>'95</sup></p>
							</div>
							<p>More issues concerning involuntary psychiatric interventions and computer technology
								will emerge in coming years, raising pressing questions. Will monitoring devices be
								imposed in involuntary psychiatric interventions in the civil context, such as ‘community
								treatment orders’? Should algorithmic technologies be used at all in coercive crisis
								responses? How might these concerns relate to broader efforts in recent years to reduce
								and eliminate coercion in mental health settings, and to debates about ‘abolishing versus
								reforming’ involuntary psychiatric interventions?<sup>96</sup></p>
								
							<p>The future of algorithmic and data-driven technologies in coercive state interventions
								remains uncertain—but imagined futures are guiding activity today. As one industry
								publication that promoted technology in healthcare stated</p>
							<div class="benifit-box">
								<ul>
									<li>In the future, patients might go to the hospital with a broken arm and leave the
										facility with a cast and a note with a compulsory psychiatry session due to flagged
										suicide risk. That’s what some scientists aim for with their A.I. system developed
										to catch depressive behavior early on and help reduce the emergence of severe
										mental illnesses.<sup>97</sup>></li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<p>This imagined future is one possibility. Others will reject this vision of expanded risk
								predictions and technology-facilitated coercion, and instead promote the development
								of open and co-operative crisis support relationships that are enhanced by selective use
								of digital technology. These contested futures suggest that the power dynamic caused
								by coercion in mental health services must be a part of the discussion concerning ‘digital
								mental health’ measures today</p>
